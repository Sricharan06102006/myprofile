    <h1>Hi, I'm Sricharan</h1>
    <p><b>I am a driven and curious technologist, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Cloud Technology and Mobile Applications at Jain University, Bangalore.

My areas of interest include:

<br>Cloud Computing</br>
<br>Internet of Things (IoT)</br>
<br>Drone Technology & Automation</br>
<br>Web & Mobile App Development</br>
<br>Cybersecurity & CTF Challenges</br>

As the Event Manager of the Cloud Club, I actively organize Capture The Flag (CTF) events and hands-on workshops, fostering a collaborative tech community.

I enjoy exploring the convergence of software and hardware, particularly through IoT-based systems and drones integrated with cloud platforms.</b></p>
