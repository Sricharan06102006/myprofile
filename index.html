    <h1>Hi, I'm Sricharan</h1>
    <p><b>I am a driven and curious technologist, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Cloud Technology and Mobile Applications at Jain University, Bangalore. I specialize in designing and developing modern solutions using Python, Java, React.js, and cloud services, with a strong focus on innovation and impact.

As the Event Manager of the Cloud Club, I actively organize engaging tech events, including Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and hands-on workshops, fostering a collaborative and curious community of tech enthusiasts.

My areas of interest include:

<br>Cloud Computing</br>

<br>Internet of Things (IoT)</br>

<br>Drone Technology & Automation</br>

<br>Web & Mobile App Development</br>

<br>Cybersecurity & CTF Challenges</br>

I enjoy exploring the convergence of software and hardware, particularly through IoT-based systems and drones integrated with intelligent cloud platforms. With a hands-on approach to learning, I love solving real-world problems through technology and building solutions that are both smart and scalable.</b></p>
